**Important**
Since the implementation of Javascript into my website, I decided to make the switch over to Visual Studio Code for many different reasons
1.) I had issues with constants (const) being detected in Brackest.io
2.) More online support for issues I run into with content I want to add
3.) I feel there is more versatility with what it has to offer and the fact it is one of the most used pieces of coding/editing software
   a.) Expanding on the last, more plugins that will help me with other languages in the future

I have decided to keep a read me to track all future progress from today onward.
A lot has already been made and implemented up to now but I kept forgetting to make one of these.

Progress report for April 2, 2020 Thursday
This is my first entry that should have been made a month or so ago.
--I have already made most of my content and scripts (using Youtube videos) and implemented them.
--A CSS style sheet is made and has changed most of the elements on my pages.
--2 JS scripts that control the navigation bar (links for mobile/tablet), and the image slider for the vehicles.

April 5, 2020 Sunday
**Had major issues getting my desktop to work from around 01:00 or 02:00 in the morning, finally working around 08:00.**

--Ran all pages through the HTML and CSS validator to ensure no apparent issues (I know a lot of what still needs fixed)
--Massive improvements to the stock page and the CSS for it
--Added comment tags for easier navigation of the CSS page

Note: The mobile and tablet view is still a little broken in areas and needs some attention.
      I am planning an optimization phase around 2 - 3 weeks from the final turn-in, but will try to iron most of the issues by next update.
