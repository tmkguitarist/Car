    <h1>Import Process & F.A.Q</h1>
    
    <main>
        <p>This page will cover the import process from checking a car out online or in person, to owning it and driving it legally.
            The first step to importing a car from Japan is to find one that you want.
            We house many different types of cars and are always attending auctions locally to acquire cars for customers from abroad.
            We are able to ship to any country whose laws allow for importing. For this process we are going to use the United States as an example.
            Each country will probably have similar documents like the ones that will be displayed below.
        </p>

        <p>As stated above, the first step is to find a car. The best way is to view an inventory on a website like ours, or visit a dealership that has the vehicle you are wanting.
            Reinstating more above information, make sure the car is compliant for the country it is going to.
            We will provide a link to a U.S. import rules site.
            <a href="https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/">NHTSA import rules</a>
            <br>
            Always make sure that the car you are looking at has some sort of valid vin tag and run a check on it. Many bad things can occur from purchasing a vehicle with an invalid vin identification.
            From registration issues to possible legal issues, just check it to save yourself a headache.
            At Import on Demand, we are proud to say every car that has came through here has had valid identification and no issue with registration.
            When purchasing a vehicle from here, we will provide english documentation and proof of the tag validity.
        </p>

        <p>While making sure the tag is compliant, we also make sure that we follow the guidelines of the United States and make sure the vehicle is not configured with non-conforming parts.
            Through our dealership if you live in the United States, you will not need to find an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI).
            We refuse to sell a car that is fitted with illegal parts or violates the twenty-five year clause.
            The reason why we refuse to use ICI's is because some the fees that you pay can be extremely high and understandingly the import process is costly enough.
            In the next section we will go over the paperwork that you must complete to be one step closer to owning your dream car.
        </p>

        <p>The first of a few forms is the EPA Form 3520-1 from the Environmental Protection Agency.
            This can be obtained from the following link: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/importing-vehicles-and-engines/epa-standard-form-3520-1-declaration-form-importation-motor-vehicles">EPA Form 3520-1</a>
            This form is about the car you're importing, make, model, use of the car, etc. The link provided will take you straight to the EPA's page where the form can be found towards the bottom.
            <br>
            The second form listed is the DOT Form HS-7 from the Department of Transportation.
            This can be obtained from the following link: <a href="http://www.dhl-usa.com/en/express/customs_support/clearance_on_demand/DOT_HS7.html">DOT Form HS-7</a>
            This form is similar to the first but also asks about port information which will be important when the car arrives at that port.
            <br>
            The last form for now at least is the CBP Form 7501 from Customs and Border Protection.
            This can be obtained from the following link: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary/cbp-form-7501">CBP Form 7501</a>
            This will be filled out at the port when the car enters the United States.
            All the paperwork needed for this like the title and manufacturer's letter will be sent to you in advance to ensure no issue prevails when acquiring the vehicle.
            To complete this form, make sure to have the EPA Form 3520-1 and DOT Form HS-7 on hand.
            <br>
            This process can be a little intimidating at first which is why all of the documents we mention will be listed at the end of this process, as well as in the contact and legal section of the website.
        </p>
        
        <p>From the paperwork, we now move to the import itself. The first thing that happens before we ship a vehicle is to clean every single spot of the it.
            The reason is to prevent any soil that may contain pests from Japan entering a country like the United States that has a ban on foreign soil contamination.
            The following is a link that goes over more details: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car">More car import rules</a>
            <br>
            For having your vehicle shipped, we are partnered with Schumacher Cargo Logistics and have a discount price for shipping if the vehicle is purchased from Import on Demand.
            Read more info on the shipper: <a href="https://www.schumachercargo.com/car-shipping/">Schumacher Cargo Logistics</a>
            <br>
            Depending on where the vehicle is imported to it can be anywhere from 10 - 40 days from purchase that it arrives at the port.
            <br>
            Keep in mind that if you cannot be at the first port of entry, you must employ a CBP broker to handle the process of the entry.
            Here is a direct link to find one if you need it: <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/contact/find-broker-by-port">Find a Broker</a>
        </p>

        <p>And the final steps of our process arrive.
            After you have completed the hefty amount of work that it takes to acquire your vehicle, there are just a few more minor things and you are good to go.
            <br>
            Finishing up at the port, you will be required to pay a duty fee which will be around 2.5% on cars (24% on trucks) for the price you paid for the vehicle.
            A federal tax will potentially be applied as well if your vehicle falls under the U.S. gas-guzzler tax (a fuel economy rating of 22.5 mpg or less).
            <br>
            And the very last step for completion: Register the vehicle and apply for license plates.
            If you have ever registered at a Department of Motor Vehicles it will be the same process, just make sure to bring all the paperwork you will have from the port just to make sure everything goes well.
            After that you will be 100% road legal and worry-free about anything else.

        <div id="faq"><h1>Welcome to the F.A.Q</h1></div>
        <br><br>
        
        <div id="ask"><p>Some of our most asked questions:<br><br></p></div>

        
        <div class="ital"><p>How is the final price of a car configured?</p></div>
        <p>The price that is listed right above the car is the price that you would pay. The only thing we do not cover is the federal tax your country would charge and the registration fees for plates. Everything else is included in that price.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="ital"><p>How long is the shipping process?</p></div>
        <p>If everything goes right, around 10 - 40 days. That is of course dependent on where the vehicle is being shipped to.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="ital"><p>Are all vehicles allowed in the United States?</p></div>
        <p>Yes, as long as the vehicle is over the twenty-five years old mark. There are some loopholes around that but you can end up paying more than what the car is worth by the end of it.
        For example a Skyline R32, all models are before 1995 which makes them old enough. A Skyline R34, the first models were made in 1999 which is a few more years away from making it legal.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="ital"><p>Does the Unites States allow right-hand drive vehicles on the roads?</p></div>
        <p>After following the steps from above, if the car is registered then it is perfectly legal to drive.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="ital"><p>Do you offer financing on vehicles?</p></div>
        <p>We are not able to do financing for customers residing outside of Japan. For a trusted source to get a qoute from, please check out the site provided:<br><a href="https://www.myautoloan.com/content-articles/import-car-loans.html">Import car qoutes & loans</a>
